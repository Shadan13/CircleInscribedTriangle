This Python project calculates the length of side, perimeter, and area of a triangle inscribed inside a circle of given radius. Also gives circumference and area of the circle. Uses the Math and Replit libraries.

This project was initially done on Replit and I'm not enitrely sure if it will work with Github so in the event that it doesn't work please head to https://replit.com/@floutdoubt/trianglecirclething#main.py thanks :)
